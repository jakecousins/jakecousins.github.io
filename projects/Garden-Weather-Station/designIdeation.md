# Design Ideation

In our team, Jeremiah and Jacob laid the groundwork for ideas, while Gavin and Brennan integrated them into our collaborative Jamboard sessions. Our most effective brainstorming involves rapid idea-forming, building upon each other's contributions. Individual brainstorming was less successful. Our process for organizing and ranking ideas was guided by customer Voice of Customer (VOC) insights. Each team member sketched a design concept: Gavin - Design Concept 3, Jeremiah - Design Concept 2, and Brennan - Design Concept 1. This division of labor resulted in a diverse portfolio of concepts catering to various user preferences.


In the process of generating design ideas, our team adhered to a systematic approach for the effective generation and evaluation of ideas. We commenced the process by employing a digital collaborative tool named Jamboard. Below is a concise overview of the steps we undertook:

1.  Jamboard Creation: Our initial step involved the creation of a Jamboard, where team members collaboratively contributed ideas. Through extensive brainstorming sessions, we successfully generated a comprehensive list of 100 diverse concepts.
    
2.  Categorization: To enhance clarity and streamline our ideas, we opted for a different method. We categorized the designs into three distinct bins, each corresponding to a potential design direction. These bins were carefully defined to encapsulate the diverse aspects of User Interaction, Materials, Hardware and Software, Design, as well as Battery/Storage considerations.
    
3.  Concept Sketches: As the third step, we translated our categorized designs into reality by creating three concept sketches/designs using CAD software. This allowed us to obtain a preliminary visualization of how the three designs identified in the categorization stage would manifest in a tangible form.

Below, our team’s Jamboard without categorization can be seen below in Figure 1![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8n1vSbGROwkQY0_1YYfFdvfFjt00AKvtBIW-74R_YryzFv4x5cmUN-iY4ndcwKo6X9-0oBNkLWjlpfIUvPoXG4VXIMERf0YZhpASdsrl5grW6Zl4gJkEGkXfI4D_yeDA8Fr7aMgyhNzl0H5tlVLtLos)

## Concept Designs

Following the organization of our Jamboard into distinct "bins" representing potential designs, we took the initiative to bring them to life visually. Consequently, the team crafted three concept sketches, each corresponding to a specific design bin formulated during the Jamboard process.

### Design 1

Design 1 contains a standup approach consisting of various manual buttons and knobs, which will change the pitch of the attached solar panel. The use of flashing LEDs for alerts, a generous LCD screen, and a panel to hide electronics is used to successfully blend into a natural environment, while producing constant solar energy during the day.

### Design 2

Design 2 The concept behind design two is to have a fully sustainable garden weather station. We wanted to incorporate a design that could easily be added to an existing garden. On board are a few different features suitable for those who want a garden weather station, some of the sensors include temperature, light sensors, soil moisture monitoring and a motor to control the on board solar panels. Having the ability to control the position of the solar panel allows for a source of power. The readings of the on board sensors can be accessed and viewed via a wifi connection.

### Design 3

Design 3 utilizes a bigger approach, but still blends into the environment by utilizing camouflaging colors. Additionally, the weather guarded solar panel on top is operated by OpenAi’s artificial intelligence, adjusting the pitch of the panel as well as sending alerts and advice. On the front of the device, one can connect to the source directly, as the device has on board power, but can also attach to external devices.
