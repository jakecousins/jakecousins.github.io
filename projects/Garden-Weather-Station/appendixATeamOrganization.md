### Process:

We will change project roles whenever necessary and not set a tricky timing for swapping positions. The decision of who will switch to what role will depend on the part team members want to change based on need. As a team, we will be given individual tasks to do for our project, but if someone needs help, whoever is available to assist will do so. If any team member needs to swap roles, we will communicate quickly and clearly about the problem and work together to resolve it. A team Gantt chart will be made for all milestones to record any essential milestones in the project. Any technical responsibility can be volunteered for by each team member. We randomly select roles if no one wants to volunteer for a role.

<br>

<br>

<br>

### Team Coordination & Accountability:

To ensure our team is accountable, we will check in on the assignments and ensure no one is stuck on any specific task. As a group, we will make sure we help each other with any problems using the preferred methods of communication. If a team member is underperforming, we will discuss with the team member what issues they may be experiencing and possible solutions, such as switching tasks with another member who can complete the task without any issues. Before any assignment is due, we will do a brief run-through to ensure we have everything answered and answer anything missed. 

<br>

<br>

<br>

### Conflict Recognition and Resolution:

If any conflict arises as a team, we will all convene via Discord and discuss the best option to resolve the conflict in an amicable solution for all parties. If the conflict gets significantly out of hand, then the instructor of this course will be involved.
