# Software Proposal

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/hbpWCdS.png)


This is our current version of our software proposal. We are trying to simplify our design as much as possible, as a whole it has only a few functions. It will be able to use the solar panel at the top of the device to help charge batteries and or power the system itself. As of right now we will be manually moving the solar panel with a predefined movement pattern that will go on throughout the day and it will reset back to the original position during the night. The on board humidity and temperature sensors will provide the key data our customers need in order to maintain their garden. We will have our sensors give the customer the data after a set amount of time has passed to keep things simple.
