After some deliberation we going with the second option. The concept behind design two is to have a fully sustainable garden weather station. We wanted to incorporate a design that could easily be added to an existing garden. On board are a few different features suitable for those who want a garden weather station, some of the sensors include temperature, light sensors, soil moisture monitoring and a motor to control the on board solar panels. Having the ability to control the position of the solar panel allows for a source of power. The readings of the on board sensors can be accessed and viewed via a wifi connection. Mechanically, we will have a watertight seal and the top solar panel section will rotate wusing onboard motor.
