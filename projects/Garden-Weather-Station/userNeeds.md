# User Needs and Benchmarks

Our team organized user needs into broad categories like User Functions, External and Material Qualities, Software and Data, and Hardware and System. Derived from customer VOCs and studying similar products, each category was further refined with subcategories. We used a 1-3 checkmark scale to prioritize ideas, assigning weights through collaboration. The team collectively assessed similar products' positive and negative reviews to determine the importance of each need.

To convert user needs into specifications, we extensively reviewed VOCs and collaborated as a team, focusing on the general takeaways from reviews of similar products. Our assessment criteria for the design are rooted in these VOC findings, ensuring our product meets the expectations gleaned from user feedback.

In documenting our decision-making process, we employed a building method. Ideas were formed collaboratively, with each team member building off of others' contributions. This ensured a systematic approach to recording and justifying decisions throughout the organization and prioritization process.

| ‚ÄúWe purchased a 2nd one for our vacation home and uploaded the data for both to our ambientweather account. it's really easy to flip back and forth between the locations and check up on things. I used the remote sensor to track over time humidity in the crawlspace and garage as we make insulation/venting changes to both locations. We added a heat pump in the vacation property.

| ‚ÄúThe humidity monitor was pretty spot on. I checked the reading before and after a light rain and it was accurate. I will be getting more of the soil sensors for different spots in my garden, since deep-rooted trees (citrus) should be water less often then shallow-rooted plants (tomatoes, guava) even when the soil moisture is the same. The luminosity monitor seems to work fine also. I use it to figure out how much sunlight certain spots are getting throughout the day in order to plant appropriate things there.

| ‚ÄúI have tested out many different soil sensor that are WiFi and or Bluetooth. This need RainPoint soil sensor is by far very superior to the older model. The accuracy is spot on when I tested it with an true manual soil gauge. It works great up to about 500 ft in my garden which the older one did not. I also found it will connect to my RainPoint weather station hub as well as the hub that comes with it. Note: Now some have posted reviews saying they cannot get it to connect. Make sure your phone is set on 2.4GHz and not 5 GHz or it will not allow you to see it. It realize on the 2.4GHz range to work with your WiFi. Another note is that some say the instructions were hard to follow but I did not have any issues with the instructions. It was very easy to setup and get working in about 15 mins. My one suggestion to RainPoint is to make a way to set a range of water percentage and if it falls below that range to sent an alert or turn on the water to bring it back to that range. I first tested in dry soil to see how it gauges the water levels and then turn on sprinkler to bring it to the right levels for vegetables. It work as it should showing the soil going up from 28% to the range 45% - 65%. The interface is easy to read but would love to see some more features like better charts (bar type or pie type). I love the temperature and sun light feature of this sensor too since I know how much sun is getting on the plants. A suggestion in this area would be a chart to show how much time the plants are getting full sun and partial sun using the Lux readings. This would be great feature add for the future. Temp is nice just know what each area is getting in terms of accurate temperatures. I like the Homgar app and the Rainpont app but I wish they were all in one single app and all they systems worked together. I am very impressed with this soil sensor and if you do automated gardening I highly recommend this sensor.‚Äù | - Accurate and reliable readings from sensors. (explicit) <br> <br> - Easy to use and control due to wifi capabilities. (explicit) <br> <br> - A desire for advanced alerts. (latent) |
| ‚ÄúI own several RainPoint products and as expected this one worked as advertised. The setup is easy and just took a few seconds to connect. The sensor measures soil moisture level, temperature, and Illuminance. The timer can set the irrigation plan according to the soil moisture avoiding over or under-watering. The app shows the current data point and data history. Also, the app provides a useful alert option. Solid design and upgraded from the previous version. The connection range is good. Overall, this product improves your gardening experience while helping to keep your plants healthy. Highly recommended.‚Äù | - Effective measurement and automated irrigation control. (explicit) <br> <br> - Reliable product performance and ease of use. (explicit) <br> <br> - User-friendly app with alerts to aid plant care. (explicit) |
|‚ÄúI garden in a hot/dry climate. So, knowing the soil moisture levels and adjusting my irrigation is crucial. Before this high-tech version, I was using a moisture meter that you place in the soil and read the gauge while standing in the blazing sun. I like that this can be read and monitored via an app. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for "easy to use" because I don't like that you can't add the device to the Rainpoint app. It only works with the HomGar app which prevents me from being able to change the watering schedule based on the soil moisture levels. Not a deal breaker but it's worth a mention. Everything else about the unit is great! I had some trouble with my first sensor staying online and after troubleshooting Rainpoint replaced the unit without question. Great customer service!‚Äù | - Being able to monitor soil moisture from the comfort of your own own. (explicit) <br> <br> - Only works with one app on the phone can be limiting.

| ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy. I bought this in August, two sensors & the hub. I just threw it out now in December. I like all the promised features. When it worked, it worked fine. However, never did both sensors stay online for a full week. Fussing with them, removing & re-initializing them, and losing the history data every time was just too tedious for too little benefit.‚Äù | - Sensors are not staying on for a full week, so there is a reliability issue.

| ‚ÄúThis moisture meter does not read soil moisture correctly. I can over water my plants and the meter will only read 70 - 80 percent moisture. When plants are dry and wilting over it reads around 60 percent moisture. This product is not accurate at all! I have better readings with a cheap 7 dollar meter. The company tried reaching out and gave me another one to try and it did the same thing. What a waste of 55 dollars.‚Äù | - An error in the software or hardware might cause bad readings.

## Product Requirements Document

### Introduction
There are many weather station devices on the market today, our goal is to stand out and deliver a product of unrivaled quality. The main components behind this product are the ability to track various aspects about the outside weather and soil moisture levels and relay that to the user to allow them to make the best decisions possible when maintaining a garden. The product will also have an automatically adjustable solar panel that tracks the sun and can deliver power to various other devices of the user‚Äôs choosing. Through the use of smart manufacturing techniques we aim to make this device affordable while having it be robust in its functions. Lastly, its ease of use should rival or beat that of other market competitors so that any person, regardless of their technical proficiency, can operate our product to get the most out of it.

<br>

### Objectives
The goal for this product is to create a portable weather station that can easily be placed in a home garden. It would be able to track a multitude of different data points including temperature, humidity, soil humidity, and level of light from the sun. The solar panels are capable of tracking the sun‚Äôs movement and adjusting the solar panel angle accordingly to get the best power generation possible. This would allow the user to charge and or power any other relevant gardening devices they may have. All data collected will have integration with a phone app and communicate that data over wifi to the user to allow for easy monitoring and maintenance of their plants. The weather station will be built out of durable materials that can withstand being exposed to the sun for extended periods of time and is durable enough to take abuse from any garden pests that might try to damage it, such as TPU (for prototyping) In the event some component breaks the parts can be easily maintained or swapped out.
