Each of us are responsible for our own subsystems to make this project come to life. We have a total of four subsystems. These include the micro controller, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and motor driver. In addition to this we have a solar panel that is not a dedicated subsystem but will be controlled by the motor driver in order to move. The micro controller is the brains of our design and will help us to control everything. The humidity and temperature sensors will gather their relevant data and feed it back to the end user. With all of these parts combined we aim to make a robust garden weather station that will be simple to use while providing valuable information for whoever uses it.
